## 🔧 Technology Stack

### Core Dependencies
```json
{
  "agentdb": "latest",
  "agentic-flow": "latest",
  "sqlite3": "^5.1.0",
  "sqlite-vec": "^0.1.0",
  "claude-flow": "@alpha"
}
```

### MCP Servers
- **Required**: `claude-flow` (orchestration)
- **Recommended**: `agentdb` (20 memory tools)
- **Optional**: `ruv-swarm`, `flow-nexus`

### System Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- 2GB RAM (4GB recommended)
- 1GB disk for patterns
- SQLite 3.x with vec extension

---

## ⚠️ Top Risks

### 1. Performance at Scale (>1M vectors)
- **Risk**: sqlite-vec brute-force degrades
- **Mitigation**: Limit <1M, monitor ANN development

### 2. Pattern Quality
- **Risk**: Poor patterns reduce effectiveness
- **Mitigation**: Seed library, validation framework

### 3. Context Complexity
- **Risk**: 5-layer architecture hard to debug
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive logging, gradual rollout

## 📚 5-Minute Deep Dive Sections

### AgentDB Architecture
- **Foundation**: SQLite (transactional) + DuckDB (analytics)
- **Vector Search**: sqlite-vec extension, cosine similarity
- **Graph Search**: HNSW multi-level indexing (when available)
- **Performance**: SIMD acceleration (AVX/NEON)
- **Scale**: Thousands to hundreds of thousands of vectors

### ReasoningBank Pipeline
```
1. STORE → Save experience as pattern (SQLite)
2. EMBED → Convert to 1024-dim vector (SHA-512)
3. QUERY → Semantic search (cosine, 2-3ms)
4. RANK → Multi-factor score (semantic, confidence, recency, diversity)
5. LEARN → Bayesian update (+20% success, -15% failure)
```

### Six Thinking Modes
1. **Convergent**: Focused, analytical
2. **Divergent**: Creative, exploratory
3. **Lateral**: Indirect, innovative
4. **Systems**: Holistic, interconnected
5. **Critical**: Evaluative, questioning
6. **Adaptive**: Flexible, context-responsive

### 5-Layer Context Architecture
1. **Meta-Context**: Agent identity, tone, persona
2. **Operational Context**: Task, user intent, tools
3. **Domain Context**: Industry-specific knowledge
4. **Historical Context**: Condensed interaction memory
5. **Environmental Context**: System state, live data
