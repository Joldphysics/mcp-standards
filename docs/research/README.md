## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Core Dependencies
```json
{
  "agentdb": "latest",
  "agentic-flow": "latest",
  "sqlite3": "^5.1.0",
  "sqlite-vec": "^0.1.0",
  "claude-flow": "@alpha"
}
```

### MCP Servers
- ✅ **Required**: claude-flow (orchestration)
- 🎯 **Recommended**: agentdb (20 memory tools)
- ⚡ **Optional**: ruv-swarm, flow-nexus (advanced features)

### System Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- 2GB RAM minimum (4GB recommended)
- 1GB disk space for pattern storage
- SQLite 3.x with vec extension support

---

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Requires Active Mitigation)
1. **Performance at scale (>1M vectors)**
   - Mitigation: Start <1M, monitor sqlite-vec ANN development

2. **Pattern quality maintenance**
   - Mitigation: Seed 50-100 patterns, validation framework

3. **Context orchestration complexity**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive logging, gradual rollout

### Medium Risk (Monitor & Plan)
- Skill creation quality → Validation framework
- Integration complexity → Phased approach
- Learning effectiveness in niche domains → Domain tuning

### Low Risk (Well-Understood)
- AgentDB stability (SQLite foundation)
- Token reduction effectiveness (proven)
- MCP tool integration (well-documented)
